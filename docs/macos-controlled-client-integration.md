# macOS controlled-client runtime

This document defines the standalone macOS role in the three-node XConnect One
validation topology. It is not a source merge with `xconnect-app`, and it does
not require a macOS host adapter or Packet Tunnel handoff.

## Topology

```text
XConnect Zero
  accounts: devices, networks, policy, signed configuration
  portal: administration UI
       |
       +--> XConnect One Gateway       AWS t4g.small Spot / Linux relay
       +--> XConnect One Linux client  AWS t4g.micro Spot / Linux CLI runtime
       +--> XConnect One macOS client  local Mac / standalone CLI runtime
                                      WireGuard over VLESS
```

The three entries are separate device roles in Zero. A macOS device has its own
device ID, WireGuard key pair, address allocation, signed configuration and
state directory. It never reuses a Linux device's credential or state.

## Cross-platform CLI contract

Linux, macOS and Windows ship one controlled-client contract: `join`, `sync`,
`status`, `diagnose`, `down`, and `leave` have identical control-plane and
state semantics. All platforms use the same invitation format, device-bound
credential, signed configuration verification, generation replay protection,
ACK policy, and explicit state-directory ownership.

Only the external runtime adapter is platform-specific. Each adapter starts
the compatible external Xray and WireGuard tools and verifies its owned
interface. It must not introduce a platform-specific Zero API, configuration
format, enrollment state, or lifecycle vocabulary.

## Runtime ownership

XConnect-One owns Zero invitation exchange, device credential and session
renewal, signature verification, replay protection, its local WireGuard key,
configuration generation, Xray/WireGuard lifecycle, status checks and ACK
sequencing. On macOS it runs the compatible externally installed `xray`, `wg`,
`wg-quick`, and `wireguard-go` WireGuard userspace/kernel tools under
administrator privileges.

The CLI creates only its declared interface and files under its explicit state
directory. It must not touch existing `utun` devices, XConnect APP settings,
APP credentials, or an APP-managed VPN connection. `down` and `leave` remove
only One-owned runtime state; `leave` also revokes the remote device.

XConnect APP remains an independent product. A future plugin may launch the
same CLI with a dedicated One state directory, but the standalone CLI does not
inspect APP state, use a private APP API, or hand profiles to a Packet Tunnel
extension. Such composition must be separately versioned and cannot change the
standalone Zero enrollment or signed-config contract.

## Data path

```text
macOS XConnect-One CLI
  -> One-owned external Xray UDP relay
  -> VLESS/XHTTP over TLS
  -> Gateway Xray
  -> Gateway WireGuard
  -> private network
```

The signed Zero configuration describes the Gateway transport and WireGuard
peer. The remote Gateway address is never replaced with a public WireGuard
endpoint: WireGuard traffic remains carried over VLESS.

## Lifecycle

1. Install the One binary on the command path and install compatible external
   Xray/WireGuard runtimes.
2. Issue a unique platform-specific invitation from Zero Portal.
3. Run `xconnect join`; One exchanges the invitation, creates its local key and
   fetches signed configuration.
4. Run `xconnect sync`; One validates the configuration, starts its local Xray
   and WireGuard processes, verifies local readiness, and ACKs the generation.
5. Verify a recent Gateway/client WireGuard handshake plus authorized private
   ping and HTTP.
6. Run `xconnect down` after a disposable test, or `xconnect leave` to revoke
   the device and remove One-owned local state.

## Security and acceptance

- Zero is the only authoritative source for device, policy and signed config.
- GitOps contains only non-sensitive topology, ports, role and digest metadata;
  Vault holds bootstrap and transport secrets.
- Private keys, invitations and raw signed configuration must not appear in
  command-line arguments, logs, public listeners, or shared APP state.
- A local process check is not network proof: acceptance requires the recent
  handshake and the authorized private ping/HTTP test.

| Check | Expected result |
|---|---|
| invite exchange | Separate platform device is created |
| signed config | Device, network, generation and ownership validate |
| runtime | Only the CLI-owned Xray/WireGuard profile changes |
| VLESS transport | WireGuard reaches Gateway through VLESS/XHTTP over TLS |
| Zero ACK | Sent after local runtime readiness is verified |
| private path | Gateway handshake and authorized ping/HTTP succeed |
| teardown | `down` removes the One-owned overlay path |
| isolation | Linux, macOS, Windows and APP credentials/state remain separate |

For a bounded already-enrolled desktop UAT run on macOS, use
[docs/desktop-uat-verification.md](desktop-uat-verification.md). The companion
Windows script follows the same check and exit-status contract. The verifier
allows `sync` to apply the CLI-owned runtime/routes but adds no routing of its
own.
